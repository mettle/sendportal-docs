# Segments

## Overview

Segments offer a convenient means of grouping subscribers together. For example, you may have one segment for your monthly newsletter and another for customers that want to be notified of a new product launch.

Segments are completely optional; a subscriber can belong to one segment, multiple segments, or none at all.

## View Segments

To view a listing of your segments, click the _Segments_ button on the subscribers index page. This will take you to the segments index.

## Adding and Updating Segments

Segments can be added in the following ways:

- through the application interface
- via the API

### Application Interface

To add a new segment through the application interface, navigate to the segments index page and click _New Segment_.

To edit a segment, click the _Edit_ button on the segment listing.

Segments are very simple and only require a `Name`, which must be unique across all segments in the current workspace.

### API

Refer to the [Segments API Documentation](/docs/api/api-segments) for information on how to manage segments through the API.
